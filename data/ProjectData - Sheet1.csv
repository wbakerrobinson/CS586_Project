1,Multnomah County Department of Human Services Developmental Disabilities Division,John Snow,john.snow@multco.gov,IDD Timesheets Review Tool,"Multnomah County Department of Human Services-Intellectual Developmental Disabilities division gets timesheets from external parties who must report their hours in a State provided time tracking system (eXPRS) and then also submit a breakdown of hours, progress notes, receipts on paper with signatures. These documents are collected and reviewed by Multnomah County employees who act as a layer of quality control and the middleman between the State and the Consultant. This job takes about 8 full time people's time since there is no software system. Proposing Microsoft .NET Core, C#, HTML 5 (Progressive Web Application), Javascript, Amazon/Azure Cognitive Services (computer vision), MS SQL Server 2017, RPA platform such as BluePrism (stretch goal due to procurement component)"
2,C-Tran,Marcus Kwong,mkwong@pdx.edu,StopSpot Data Pipeline,"PSU CS Student Marcus Kwong needs a data engineering pipeline to automatically process, clean and store dynamic vehicle location data produced by C-TRAN, the Transit Agency for Clark County, WA. Over the past several months Marcus (with other PSU students) produced a prototype application that analyzes dynamic bus event data and compares it to static bus stop location data to automatically identify stops that might be inaccurate or in need of updates. The prototype required significant manual cleaning/engineering of the transit data, and these steps now need to be automated for the project to move forward. This project probably will involve Python, scripting and SQL."
3,Multnomah County Detention Center,Sarah Smith,ssmith@multco.gov,Entity Store,"A system to store and query unstructured and semi-structured data. In scope are data which include people such as ""workers"" (employees at Multnomah County) or ""juveniles"" (offenders in the juvenile justice system), or ""inmates"" (adults booked and housed in the Multnomah County Detention Center). While each of these types share common attributes they can also be different. For example, a worker will have one preferred first and last name and one legal first and last name. But while an inmate will have one legal first and last name but can have many street names or nicknames (AKA names).  Net, API, Azure, etc."
4,Multnomah County,jeramiah jenkins,jeramiahj@multco.gov,Internal Services Directory,"Multnomah County provides a wide variety of services externally to the community and internally to other departments in order to serve the community. Without visibility, county employees are unaware what services exist, and are unable to collaborate as One County to provide inclusive customer service. This project is aimed at building awareness of county services, promoting collaboration, and removing barriers with the goal of developing a way for county employees to connect with each other. Technologies leveraged can be .Net or Drupal."
5,OG Systems,Real OG,realog@ogsystems.biz,Imagery Metadata Management System,"OGSystems does geospatial, image processing, VR, etc. for defense and geospatial intelligence applications. They have an older imagery metadata management system that is well liked by their users/clients. It has limitations, they would like it replaced. This is a nice-to-have project, not a critical path project. The image data typically consists of multi-camera (multi-sensor) imagery for a geographic region. The capstone project would be to produce a system for handling the metadata for such imagery data. The system might work like a GIS system, i.e., it would organize the metadata, give query access to the metadata and allow clients to access the imagery data corresponding to the queried metadata."
6,Enterprise Health,George Adams,gadams@ehealth.net,Azure Dashboard,"Build an enterprise application health dashboard that customers can leverage to determine the status of county applications in a Hybrid-Cloud Environment. Dashboard will incorporate a security model to determine the level of detail displayed depending on the consumers role in the organization. Some of the technologies leveraged might be: Azure Enterprise Service Bus, Event Grids, Event Hubs, Log Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure Monitor, C#, Python, Powershell, Azure SQL Database, CosmosDB, API Management"
7,Evergreen Curling club,Irene Wilson,curlingworld@curlingor.org,Curling League Registration System,"Evergreen Curling Club (Beaverton, OR) currently uses a generic first-come-first-serve event registration system to allow its members to register for curling leagues. These leagues are in high demand, so the FCFS system leads to computer systems issues as well as disgruntled curlers. They would like something better, something unique to them and something that maybe uses a lottery system similar to the New York Marathon in which scarce entries are allotted according to curlers based on their volunteer work, history of participation and other factors."
8,Tobacco Prevention and Control Program,"Lauren Lapidus
",llapidus@tobaccoprev.org,Tobacco Retail Licensing Application,"Tobacco Prevention and Control Program works to prevent and reduce tobacco and nicotine usage through prevention efforts and enforcement of local and state regulations. In addition to being the leading contributor to premature death in Multnomah County, tobacco use is a health equity issue.  The tobacco retailers will use an online portal to access to apply for a new license, renew an existing license, pay fees, verify current account balance, or change/update information. Public view provides the history of licensure and inspection of tobacco retailers, including details such as business name and location, license status, expired licenses, and other basic information. Technologies leveraged can be .Net or SalesForce"
