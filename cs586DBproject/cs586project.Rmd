# About
This project was created by Will and Kevin for CS 586. It is designed to help with the analysis of surveys relating to the PSU Senior Capstone Class. Hopefully this document, and the database created will be able to be used for easier selection of project teams, and the summary of other capstone related information.
Some notes about our program:  
(@) This program will create a database of the information supplied on whichiver database you provide credentials for. This should work as long as the database is Postgres.  
(@) After the database is created you will get this document as a .html with answers to the 20 questions.  
(@) If there are no files submited at the start the program will atempt to conenct to the database and run the report.  
(@) The file upload format for the availability survey, project interest survey, and projects information is .csv. We expect excel files for the eligibility information document.  

# 20 Questions     
## Interst Level  
### List students based on project of interest:  

### Count the number of students interested in each project:  

### Which project garnered the least amount of interest?  

### Are there more students who marked low interest in all projects than students who marked high interest in all projects?  

### What is the average amount of interest for project 3?  

### How many students listed more than 5 skills or subjects that interest them the most?  

### Is there at least one pair of students where each student has similar degrees of interest in a project and where a subject that one student feels the most knowledgeable about is the same subject that the other student feels the least knowledgeable about? 

### How many students share a favorite programming language with another student who expresses the same confidence level for at least one project?  

## Availability  
### When are most students available?  

### What proportion of students are available past 6:00 Pm?  

### What proportion of students perfer times before 8:00 Am?

### What is the minimum number of time slot availabilities of any student?  

### Which students have preferred times that are not available times?  

## Skills
### What are the most common skills?  

### What are some of the least common skills?  

### Where do skills not match with eligibility criteria?  

### Of the students who expressed at least moderate interest in over half the projects, what percentage of them also expressed at least moderate confidence in their skill?   

### What is the most common skill among those who got straight Aâ€™s in their prerequisite courses?  

## Miscellaneous
### Which student left the most additional comments?  

### Is the proportion of solo workers who responded to the prompt regarding anything else to know about them greater than or less than the proportion of non-solo workers who responded?  

```{python}
if(connected):
  conn.close()
