# 20 Questions     
## Interst Level  
### Count the number of students interested in each project:  
_# of students with interest level greater than 5_  

### Count the number of times a project was selected as a top 3 choice:  

### Are there more students who marked low interest in all projects than students who marked high interest in all projects?  
_How to define low vs. high interest?_  

### Output a list of the 5 students who have the highest interest level for each project:  

### Create a scatterplot of interest level and confidence to complete each project:  

### What skills are students most interested in?  

## Availability  
### When are most students available?  
_Create a heatmap_

### Plot students time availability stratified by 1st choice of project:  

### Plot students time availability stratified by 2nd choice of project:  

### Plot students time availability stratified by 3rd choice of project:  

### What proportion of students perfer times before 10:00 Am?

### What proportion of students are available past 6:00 Pm? 

## Skills
### What are the 5 most common skills?  

### What are the 5 least common skills?  

### What is the most common skill among those who got straight Aâ€™s in their prerequisite courses?  
_Do they have to have an A in all pre-reqs? How many people actually did this?_  

### Return a list of the 5 students who are most confident in their ability to complete each project:  

### Create a histogram of the students confidence level in completing each project:  

### Create a barchart of the skills students are skilled in or familiar with:  

## Eligibility
### How many students do not meet eligibility criteria?   

### Where do skills not match with eligibility criteria?  
_May be hard to match skills and classes taken..._  

### What is the average confidence level of students who do not meet eligibility criteria for each project?
