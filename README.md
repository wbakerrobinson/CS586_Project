## Project for Databases class CS 586 at PSU
This project was created by Will Baker-Robinson and Kevin Ng for CS 586. It is designed to help with the analysis of surveys relating to the PSU Senior Capstone Class. Hopefully this document, and the database created will be able to be used for easier selection of project teams, and the summary of other capstone related information. The project user interface for the project was created using the R package shiny. Parameters are given to an R markdown file which then connects to a database using Psycopg2. We first attempted to use an ODBC postgres driver, but this proved to be too much of a headache to set up. Cleaning of data is done using tidyverse. This data is uploaded to a Postgres database, and then used to answer questions about the data. Finally an html markdown report is generated for the user with the answers. The data is small enough the we could have completed this project just using memory, but it was done for a databases class.
Some notes about our program:  
1. This program will create a database of the information supplied on whichiver database you provide credentials for. This should work as long as the database is Postgres.  
2. After the database is created you will recieve a document as a .html file with answers to our 20 questions.  
3. If there are no files submited at the start the program will atempt to conenct to the database and run the report.  
4. We expect .csv files for all data
